# 'Tic-Tac-Toe' by Bernie
###### (...or 'Ta-Te-Ti' in Spanish if you were curious)

## Introduction:

This Tic-Tac-Toe is my very first developing project! It consists on a very simple game, however, coding it wasn't so simple.

The goal of the game is to achieve a line of three elements (X or O in my version of the game) before the other contestant.

There probably many features of the game that I could have improved, however I am very happy with the result and I hope you enjoy it as well!

``` javascript
    console.log(`Sugestions & ${feedbacks}`);
```

## Technologies:

In this project I used the following languages:
  * HTML
  * CSS
  * Javascript

Besides, I used Jquery's library and [Fun Text](http://briznad.github.io/funText/) plug in.

## Functionalities:

Some of the features my game version includes are:

* It allows users to log their names for a customised enjoyment.
* I keeps track of the players score.
* It allows players to restart the game allowing them to change their names.
* It provides links to similar online games.
* It displays pop up signs when a player wins and when neither wins.
* It keeps track of the players turns in case they forget who's next.

## Project status:

Having a functional game I am happy to say that the game is finished. However, I will be happy to make changes and include further features upon feedbacks and recommendations.
